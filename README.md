# AutoLSF
Scripts for regioselectivity prediction


AutoLSF is a series of models that can predict the reaction sites of a number of C-H activation reactions. The first one we publish is the electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS). Please see the readme file in the corresponsding section for more details.
